config DM_RESET
	bool "Enable reset controllers using Driver Model"
	depends on DM && OF_CONTROL
	help
	  Enable support for the reset controller driver class. Many hardware
	  modules are equipped with a reset signal, typically driven by some
	  reset controller hardware module within the chip. In U-Boot, reset
	  controller drivers allow control over these reset signals. In some
	  cases this API is applicable to chips outside the CPU as well,
	  although driving such reset isgnals using GPIOs may be more
	  appropriate in this case.

config RESET_SUNXI
	bool "RESET support for Allwinner SoCs"
	depends on DM_RESET && ARCH_SUNXI
	default y
	help
	  This enables support for common reset driver for
	  Allwinner SoCs.
